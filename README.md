<h2> Thesis Work </h2>

<h3> Master's Thesis: Detection of Anomalous Events in Videos </h3>
Currently working on deep learning based models for detection of anomalous events in video data. It will help automate surveillance.

<h3> Bachelor's Thesis: Prediction of Drill String Failures </h3>
Mechanical model of the drill string under various loads was used to perform fatigue analysis to predict twist off and washout. It was undertaken as a collaboration between IIT Guwahati and ONGC.

<h2> Internships </h2>

<h3> Detection of Transaction Related Activities </h3>

**Organization:** *Target India Corporation, Bangalore*

*May-July, 2019*

Achieved about 65% top-1 accuracy in recognizing 4 important activities identified across 180 transactions - Scanning, Payment, Using Phone and Using hand scanner. SVM and Logistic Regression models were used on features extracted using Rank Pooling, Dynamic Image and C3D net. The skewness in the data resulted in poor results.

<h3> Development of Simulator for 3-DOF Robot Arms </h3>

**Organization:** *Mechatronics Lab, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati*

*May-July, 2017*

Developed a MATLAB based simulator for 3-DOF robotic arms. The simulator could plan paths, compute the kinematics and dynamics of the arm based on the input D-H parameters, masses and moments of inertia, waypoints, speed and acceleration requirements and trajectory types.

<h3> Modeling of Drill String Failures </h3>

**Organization:** *Institute of Drilling Technology, ONGC, Dehradun and Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati*

*May-July, 2016*

Understood the drilling process in detail. Studied various drill string failure modes.
